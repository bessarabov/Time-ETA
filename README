# Time::ETA

This is an experimental Perl module Time::ETA.

It is not ready. You can look `examples/simple.pl` to see the interface that
is planned. The script is working, but the code is not formalized. There is no
pod and no test.

## TODO

At first I want to ask at perlmonks.org it this module is worth working on, or
there is something similar on CPAN.

If there is noting on CPAN that solves this simple task, try to use this code
in Term::ProgressBar to check the design.
